#TODO:
# You need to generate answer in audio format based on the audio message:
#   - Create Client that is similar with OpenAIClients but extracts from message audio (instead of content)
#   - Call API
#   - Get response as base64 content, decode and save as .mp3 file
# ---
# Hints:
#   - Use /v1/chat/completions endpoint
#   - Use gpt-4o-audio-preview model
#   - Use modalities=["text", "audio"]
#   - Use audio={"voice": "ballad", "format": "mp3"}
#   - Use similar method to encode audio as you have done for images encoding
