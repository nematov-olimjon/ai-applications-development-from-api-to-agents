# Agent Skills

In this task, you will explore **Agent Skills** — a way to extend AI agents with reusable, self-contained capabilities
packaged as files (instructions, scripts, references). You will implement skill-based agents for both Anthropic and
OpenAI,
and then build a **custom agent** that loads and executes skills entirely on your own infrastructure.

## Tasks

### Prepare Skills

**It is okay to use AI to prepare skills based on TODO provided in there.**

Open [_skills](_skills) and implement all `TODO` items:
   - [_skills/calculator/SKILL.md](_skills/calculator/SKILL.md), script is already implemented
   - [_skills/style-guide](_skills/style-guide):
     - [_skills/style-guide/SKILL.md](_skills/style-guide/SKILL.md)
     - [_skills/style-guide/EXAMPLES.md](_skills/style-guide/EXAMPLES.md)
     - [_skills/style-guide/REFERENCE.md](_skills/style-guide/REFERENCE.md)

## 🚨 Using skills via the Anthropic and OpenAI APIs consumes a large number of input tokens. Be careful, as costs can escalate very quickly.

### Anthropic Skills (Beta)

> **Important:** Anthropic Skills are currently in **beta** and may sometimes produce unexpected results or behave
> inconsistently. This is expected — the feature is still evolving.

1. Open [anthropic_app.py](anthropic_app.py) and implement all `TODO` items
2. Run `anthropic_app.py` and test it using the **Style Guide** and **Calculator** sample requests below.
3. To switch between skills, change `skill_id` in `main()` to use either `STYLE_SKILL_DIR`/`STYLE_SKILL_TITLE` or
   `CALCULATOR_SKILL_DIR`/`CALCULATOR_SKILL_TITLE`.
4. Test it with samples below

---

### Sample Requests: Style Guide

```
Rewrite this for our brand: "We are pleased to inform you that your request has been processed successfully by our dedicated support team."
```

```
What are the rules for writing LinkedIn posts according to our style guide?
```

```
Show me an example of a bad support email and how to rewrite it using our brand voice.
```

---

### Sample Requests: Calculator

```
What is 2^10?
```

```
What is (144 * 3) + sqrt(256) - 2^8?
```

```
What is sin(pi / 2) + cos(0)?
```

```
What is 2^10 + sqrt(144)?
```

---

### OpenAI Skills

1. Open [openai_app.py](openai_app.py) and implement all `TODO` items
2. Run `openai_app.py` and test it using the **Style Guide** and **Calculator** sample requests below.
3. To switch between skills, change the skill name and directory in `main()`.
4. Test it with samples above

### Custom Agent Skills

Instead of relying on a managed VM provided by Anthropic or OpenAI, the custom agent loads skills from the **local
filesystem** and executes Python code via an external **MCP Python Code Interpreter**.

**How it works:**

- `read_skill` tool: reads any skill file (SKILL.md, scripts, references) directly from disk. The agent calls it to
  load skill instructions before acting.
- `execute_code` tool (via MCP): runs Python code in a persistent session managed by the MCP server.

### Setup: MCP Python Code Interpreter

The custom agent requires the MCP Python Code Interpreter server running locally. Start it with [Docker Compose](docker-compose.yml):

```
MCP_URL = "http://localhost:8050/mcp"
```

Python Code Interpreter will provide only one tool:
```json
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "execute_code",
            "description": "Execute Python code in a persistent Jupyter kernel environment.\n\nMaintains stateful execution where variables, imports, and state persist across multiple calls in the same session.\n\nArgs:\n    code: Python code to execute (multi-line supported)\n    session_id: Session identifier (empty string or \"0\" for first call, then reuse returned ID)\n\nReturns:\n    dict with:\n        - success (bool): Execution status\n        - output (list): stdout/stderr text\n        - result (str|None): Last expression value\n        - error (str|None): Error message if failed\n        - traceback (list): Full traceback if error\n        - files (list): File references with URIs\n        - session_info (dict|None): Session info for new sessions (includes session_id)",
            "parameters": {
                "properties": {
                    "code": {
                        "title": "Code",
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "session_id": {
                        "default": "",
                        "title": "Session Id",
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "code"
                ],
                "type": "object"
            }
        }
    }
```
