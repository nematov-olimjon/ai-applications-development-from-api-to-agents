## About the Course

This is a **Python course** focused on building AI-powered applications by working directly with APIs. 
Instead of relying on tools like LangChain that abstract away the internals, we go straight to the API level. By the
end, when you do use frameworks, you'll understand exactly what's happening under the hood.

**What this course IS:**

- API-first approach to building AI applications
- 80% hands-on practice with real-world tasks, no "Hello World" exercises
- A challenging journey that mirrors actual AI application development work

**What this course is NOT:**

- Not an ML course: we won't dive into transformers, training, or how LLMs work internally
- Not a prompt engineering course: we expect you to already know how to write prompts and understand that different
  models behave differently with the same input


> ⚠️ This is not an easy course. You will be building the same things professional AI developers build daily.

> 💡 What you get from this course depends on you. We designed it as a practical reference you can return to and reuse in your daily work.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **IDE** (PyCharm, VS Code, or any preferred editor)
- **Postman** (for testing API calls)
- **Docker** with Docker Compose
