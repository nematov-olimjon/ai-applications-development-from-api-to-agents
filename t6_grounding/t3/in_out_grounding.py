#TODO: Info about app:
# HOBBIES SEARCHING WIZARD
# Searches users by hobbies and provides their full info in JSON format:
#   Input: `I need people who love to go to mountains`
#   Output:
#     ```json
#       "rock climbing": [{full user info JSON},...],
#       "hiking": [{full user info JSON},...],
#       "camping": [{full user info JSON},...]
#     ```

# 1. Since we are searching hobbies that persist in `about_me` section - we need to embed only user `id` and `about_me`!
#    It will allow us to reduce context window significantly.
# 2. Pay attention that every 5 minutes in User Service will be added new users and some will be deleted. We will at the
#    'cold start' add all users for current moment to vectorstor and with each user request we will update vectorstor on
#    the retrieval step, we will remove deleted users and add new - it will also resolve the issue with consistency
#    within this 2 services and will reduce costs (we don't need on each user request load vectorstor from scratch and pay for it).
# 3. We ask LLM make NEE (Named Entity Extraction) https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-entity-extraction?hl=en
#    and provide response in format:
#    {
#       "{hobby}": [{user_id}, 2, 4, 100...]
#    }
#    It allows us to save significant money on generation, reduce time on generation and eliminate possible
#    hallucinations (corrupted personal info or removed some parts of PII (Personal Identifiable Information)). After
#    generation we also need to make output grounding (fetch full info about user and in the same time check that all
#    presented IDs are correct).
# 4. In response we expect JSON with grouped users by their hobbies.

# This sample is based on the real solution where one Service provides our Wizard with user request, we fetch all
# required data and then returned back to 1st Service response in JSON format.

# TASK:
# Implement such application as described on the `flow.png` with adaptive vector based grounding and 'lite' version of
# output grounding (verification that such user exist and fetch full user info)
